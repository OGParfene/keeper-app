# keeper-app
I've made this project in order to reply the Google Notes app and to improve and put onto test my React skills.

How to try the app:
Firs we have to install all the npm modules

> $ npm install

Afterwards, we have to run the server

> $ npm run start

Finally you will get a new page opened in your browser with the React app.
